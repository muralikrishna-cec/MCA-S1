                  In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supportingbranches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, includingonly woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above aspecified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are
                  also trees. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight.
