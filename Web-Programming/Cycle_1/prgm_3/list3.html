               is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm witheggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from differentindividuals in a population) resulting from cross-pollination or allow selfing (fusion ofsperm and egg from the same flower) when self-pollination occurs.
