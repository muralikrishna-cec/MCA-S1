      <p> The festival of Onam is celebrated throughout the state of Kerala. Kerala during Onam ismarked by happiness, excitement and enjoyment among all sections of people. Onam is
          celebrated as an outcome of reasons that have to do with mythology as well as old agrarianpractices. If one is to go by the myth, then King Mahabali or Maveli was a generous and
          virtuous ruler, who had once ruled Kerala. This occasion is celebrated by all Keralites as Onam.And the other cause for celebrating Onam is because it is the time of the year when 
          a goodharvest has been gathered all over Kerala, resulting in plenitude and happiness.
