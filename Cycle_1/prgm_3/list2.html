                  Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. Theoriginal meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all
                  edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. Analternative definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and
                 cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers,nuts, and cereal grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowerssuch as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.
